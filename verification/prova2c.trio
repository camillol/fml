variables
	a:[0..1],
	b:[0..1]

axioms
	x:
		Past(a=1,1) -> b=1;
	y:
//		b <> 1;
		1=1 -> b <> 1;

// prop to check: a = 0
	z:
//		a <> 0;
		1=1 -> a <> 0;

// this way s must eventually become 0
// if a is 0, z fails
// if a is 1, at the next cycle b is 1 and y fails

// there's the usual weird problem where a simple "a <> 0" is ignored by t2p!
